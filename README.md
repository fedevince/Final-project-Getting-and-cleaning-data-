# Final-project-Getting-and-cleaning-data-
R project for the Coursera class on getting and cleaning data

This repository contains the final project for the third class in the Data Science
specialization, in particular the following files are included:

1) run_analysis.R, a program that downloads the Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Data Set, merges the relevant tables into a single one and tidies up
the data.
This is done following these steps:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2) CodeBook.md, that describes the variables studied and the operations that took place to
clean up the data

3) Final.txt, that is the output of the final task of the assignment

4) this readme.md file
